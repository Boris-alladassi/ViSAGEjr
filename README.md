## 2. How to install ViSAGEjr?

### 2.1. First install R and RStudio

Installing and running ViSAGEjr on the local computer requires the installation of R and RStudio.
To install R, go to the official R website: <https://cran.r-project.org>. Click on the appropriate link for your operating system: "Download R for Windows" or "Download R for macOS".
Run the downloaded installer and follow the setup instructions (default options are fine).

To install RStudio, go to the RStudio download page: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>. Scroll down to the RStudio Desktop and click the download link for your operating system (Windows or macOS).
Run the downloaded installer and complete the installation. Finally, open RStudio from your applications, and it should automatically detect R installation.

### 2.2. Downloading the app

The repository can be downloaded manually from GitHub or cloned from the command line.
To download manually, go to the GitHub repository page and click the green “Code” button, then select “Download ZIP”. After downloading, unzip the folder to access the files.

To clone the repository using the command line, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

`git clone https://github.com/Boris-alladassi/ViSAGEjr.git`

This will create a local copy of the repository on your computer. Make sure you have Git installed before using this command.

### 2.3. Setting working directory

To begin, unzip the folder downloaded, if done properly a new folder will be created named **ViSAGEjr**. Now, open R or R Studio and set your working directory to this folder **ViSAGEjr**.\
You may use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+H` (for Windows, probably `Cmd+Shift+H` for Mac), or you may edit the code below to set the working directory to the relative path where the directory is located on your computer.

`setwd("C:/Users/aboris/Documents/Postdoc/code/ViSAGEjr")`

### 2.4. Source the *app.R* file

Next, source the *app.R* file to get **ViSAGEjr** ready for running. Please use the code below after you have set your working directory to ViSAGEjr.

`source("./app.R")`

This may take a while, as it will install all the required R packages, that you currently do not have.

### 2.5. Run ViSAGEjr

**ViSAGEjr** can now run using the code below.

`shiny::runApp()`

At this point, the app should be up running. Please test the app as thoroughly as you can. Explore both the Standard and Fun panels. Record any abnormal behavior and share your feedback and suggestions with us at [**aboris@illinois.edu**](mailto:aboris@illinois.edu) or [**alipka@illinois.edu**](mailto:alipka@illinois.edu).

### 2.6. Alternative access to ViSAGEjr

If a user is not able to install and run the app on their local computer, they can access it at <https://borisalladassi.shinyapps.io/visagejr/>. Simply copy and paste the URL in your browser, and it will start running. **It is worth noting that due to memory limitation, running the app from a the URL is much slower than running it locally.**
